			<h3> Overview</h3>
            
            <p class="mb-5">Facebook Messenger is a messaging application that enables people to connect and interact with one another. As a very well known product, Facebook has made proper accomodations to meet the basic needs of their users on this application. This take on the Facebook Messenger redesign is a passion project.</p>


            <h3>Problem</h3>
			
            <p class="mb-5">The issues with the 2017 - 2018 designed version of the product were that there was a difficulty in navigability, especially when it came to locating a user's profile and their settings, features that were not core to the application were highlighted over some of the core features, and group chats were two dimensional and didn't promote much activity outside of simply chatting.</p>

            <div class="row mb-5">
              <div class="col-md-6">
			  <h3>UX Challenges</h3>
			  
                <p>Every well known product receives critiques as to how it should function. The same holds true to Facebook Messenger, in which different users can have different opinions as to how the messaging application should work at its core. Finding a central point where everyone can be completely satsified was a challenge.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
			  <h3>Goals</h3>
			  
                <p>The goal of the redesign was to highlight the essential features in replace of the non-essential features to deconvolute the navigation and to promote more engagement and activity within the group chat feature.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

			<h3>User Surveys</h3> 
				<p class="mb-5">A 20 question survey questionnaire was created and sent out to people who have used Facebook Messenger. I received 10 valuable responses from these users. The questions targeted the main functionalities of the application. Here are the highlighted quotes that drove my solution to enriching the user experience on Facebook Messenger.</p>

        <div class="full-screen-image">

		</div>
			<p>After receiving these responses from Facebook Messenger users, I identified some of the key takeaways.  </p>
				<ol>
				<b><li>Relevance is key</li></b>
				<p>Users felt that irrelevant features distracted from the core principles of the application. In addition, unfamiliar features within a well known product can create confusion and even distrust.</p>
				<b><li>Simple, streamlined experience is favored</li></b>
				<p>Users would like a simple feature that would allow them to quickly engage with their friends and family in an intuitive way. Features that can spark further interaction within the core principles would be something they would enjoy as well.</p>
				<b><li>Familiarity drives good experiences</li></b>
				<p>Users use Facebook Messenger to help the complete one apparent goal, to message others. Users want to see this function highlighted first and have other supporting features help further entice usages of the messaging application.</p>
				</ol>
<br>
		<h3>Defining the problem</h3>
		<p>With the collected data, I was able to create a problem statement,<b>"How might I enhance the navigation experience on Facebook Messenger and entice user engagement within the group chat feature?"</b></p>

		<h3> Final Thoughts</h3>
		<p>Messaging applications and platforms are finding new ways to increase traction with new features and experiences. However, we must keep in mind that the most optimal experience, being the streamlined one, will always serve for a better product to get the needed task done. Efficiency is key to a great messenger application, as for any product.
